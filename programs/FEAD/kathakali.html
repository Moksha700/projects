        <h2>About Kathakali</h2>
        <p>
            Kathakali is a major form of classical Indian dance. It is a "story play" genre of art, but one distinguished by its elaborately colorful make-up, costumes and face masks wearing actor-dancers, who have traditionally been all males.

        <h2>Origins and History</h2>
        <p>
            Originating in the state of Kerala in the 17th century, Kathakali draws heavily from Hindu mythology, especially the Puranas. It is a blend of dance, music, drama, and expresses ancient stories from the Hindu epics Ramayana and Mahabharata.

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <p>
            One of the most striking features of Kathakali is its use of elaborate makeup and costumes. These are highly symbolic and among the most recognized icons of Indian culture. The makeup follows an accepted code, which helps to convey the character.

        <h2>Performance Elements</h2>
        <p>
            Kathakali is structured around plays known as Attakatha (enacted stories), written in Sanskritized Malayalam. The performances, which traditionally last for several hours, combine intricate footwork, expressive hand gestures, and facial expressions to
            narrate the story.

        <h2>Music and Instruments</h2>
        <p>
            The music of Kathakali has some similarity to the larger body of South Indian classical music (Carnatic sangeet); however, the instrumentation is decidedly different. Its main instruments are the chenda, maddalam (types of drums), and the edakka (an hourglass-shaped
            drum).
