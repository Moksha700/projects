        <p>
            The origins of Kuchipudi date back to the 17th century and was originally performed exclusively by men. It was known as 'Bhagavatamela', and it was a dance-drama performance form. The modern version of Kuchipudi was shaped by the efforts of pioneers like
            Vedantam Lakshminarayana Sastry.
